Repo from paper [Synthetic data generation for digital twins: enabling production systems analysisin the absence of data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/0951192X.2024.2322981?needAccess=true)

# How to use (Maxi)
- example graph can be built in `src/graph_example.py`
- example simulation can be done in `src/manufacturing_example.py`

## General notes
- use of igraph library vs. i used networkx for visualization in `src/graph_example.py`
- it does not all work out of the box
- did not yet understand the simulation to great detail
- asking the question, what is actually the goal of understanding this?
  - not really complex, not really adaptable.
